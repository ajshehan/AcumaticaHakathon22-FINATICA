FINATICA

Abstract

Sometimes, companies need to change the existing calendar that is assigned to a ledger and assign a new calendar based on the company policy changes and business requirement changes. Therefore, this solution comprises an extension for Acumatica ERP to change the financial calendar from the current calendar year to any defined fiscal year
e.g.: Customers will be able to change their current calendar (e.g.: Jan to Dec financial calendar) to any fiscal calendar (e.g.: Apr to Mar).
 
Proposed Solution

A new mapping screen will be introduced to define a mapping between the current financial calendar and the expected financial calendar. After that, the user can process the defined mapping to initiate the new financial calendar. With the initiation of the process, it will transfer current financial period data to the newly defined financial calendar.

Features

Customers do not want to repair their data manually. This will be a fully automated process.
* Benefits/ Usability of the solution

Can optimize financial reporting exposure to seasonal fluctuations
* Enhancing comparability among peers
* Change fiscal year to Tax Compliance/ Operational convenience taxation
* Change the company's fiscal period for stock-trading reasons.
